# React HOC demo in TypeScript

This is repo related to my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@DanHomola/react-higher-order-components-in-typescript-made-simple-6f9b55691af1) on React Higherâ€“Order Components.

## How to use

To try it yourself, just clone this repository and then run
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

For the best experience, I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Acknowledgements

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), using the wonderful [TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) project.
